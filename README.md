# Ansible
Repo gives brief info on how to use Ansible for configuration management

# Getting Started with Ansible

If you are just starting with Ansible, follow the steps below to get started.

## Step 1: Setup EC2 Instances

1. Create one EC2 instance and name it `Ansible_Server`.
2. Create two more EC2 instances and name them `Target_Server1` and `Target_Server2`.

## Step 2: Install Ansible

1. Login to `Ansible_Server` via SSH or Session Manager and execute the following commands:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install ansible -y
    ```

2. Verify whether Ansible is installed by running the command:

    ```bash
    ansible --version
    ```

## Step 3: Enable Passwordless Authentication

1. **Generate Public and Private Key on `Ansible_Server`**:

    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
    ```

    Follow the instructions and press enter to generate the key in the default path.

2. **Copy the Public Key to Target Servers**:

    ```bash
    ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub -o "IdentitiesOnly=yes" -i /path/to/your.pem ubuntu@target_server1_ip
    ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub -o "IdentitiesOnly=yes" -i /path/to/your.pem ubuntu@target_server2_ip
    ```

3. **Verify SSH Access to Target Servers**:

    ```bash
    ssh ubuntu@target_server1_ip
    ssh ubuntu@target_server2_ip
    ```

## Step 4: Create an Inventory File

Create an inventory file and enter the Target Servers' IP addresses using the command:

```bash
vim inventory
```

## Step 5: Run Ansible Ad-Hoc Command

Run the following Ansible ad-hoc command to create files on the Target Servers:

```bash
ansible -i inventory all -m "shell" -a "touch /tmp/sample"
```

Now you can verify whether the files are created on the Target Servers or not.

## Step 6: Run Ansible playbook instead of Ad-Hoc commands

1. If you want to run multiple tasks on target machines go with Ansible Playbook.
2. Create Ansible Playbook and write the tasks in YAML.
3. After Creating Playbook execute below command to run tasks on target machines.

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory all playbook.yml
```
